# UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL DIFFUSION DYNAMICS USING NETWORKED COGNITIVE SYSTEMS

Daniel Chen

Binary decision models with externalities is a class of models that describe individuals making
a simple binary choice, whose decision depends on other people. This class of models is generalizable
to infectious diseases, decision making, information spread, fads, riots, etc. However,
binary decision models are not rich enough to describe the complex process of human attitude
formation that eventually lead to behaviors.

The Theory of Reasoned Action is a health behavior model that states behaviors stem from a
series of beliefs. This theory is used as the computational framework for constraint-satisfaction
artificial neural-networks which allow us to model psychologically plausible decisions on an individual
level. This model can be combined with agent-based models, which model health behavior
at a population level in order to add psychology into a dynamic social network framework.
This new framework for epidemiological modeling of health behaviors where the agents may
exhibit psychological plausible decisions allows us to study the spread of ideas within a social
network. This will give us insights as to what drives behavioral risk factors for population health
behaviors.
